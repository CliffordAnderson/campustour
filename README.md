#Campus Tour

The goal of this project is to create a light-weight, mobile ready map of campus points-of-interest using open source technologies. 

##Technologies

The project uses:

- [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) to encode GIS data points;
- [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/) to store the GIS data points;
- [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) for the interactive GIS layer;
- [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/) to create the visual popups.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for web design.

All code contributed by the staff members of the Jean and Alexander Heard Library is licensed under the GPLv3. Third-party code is governed by the respective licenses.

##Installation Instructions

###Prerequisites

###GeoJSON

###Cloudant

IBM [Cloudant] is a hosted version of [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/). CouchDB is a document-oriented database that stores data as JSON, uses Javascript for writing Map/Reduce functions, and communicates with applications via HTTP. Cloundant provides a fast and easy way to get started with CouchDB without installing anything on your computer or setting up a server. These characteristics make it easy to store GeoJSON features in the "Cloud" and to send those features on demand to users.
