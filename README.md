Campus Tour
===========

The goal of this project is to create a light-weight, mobile ready map of campus points-of-interest using open source technologies. 

###Technologies

- [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) to encode GIS data points;
- [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) for the interactive GIS layer;
- [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/) to create the visual popups.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for web design.
